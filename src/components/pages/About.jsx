                <p>I'm Esat, a 14 year old who has a passion for math and programming. I'm a self-thought full stack programmer and can both visualize and handle data. But there is much more to that! Which is why i separated them to two different pages. Here i just want to introduce myself ðŸ˜‰</p>

                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Like i said, i like math and programming, i attended to several math competitions and solve coding challenges like <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="blank">advent-of-code</a> every few days. But aside from that i really enjoy being alongside wildlife and love every creature. Other activities i enjoy definitely includes swimming (at sea) and basketball.
